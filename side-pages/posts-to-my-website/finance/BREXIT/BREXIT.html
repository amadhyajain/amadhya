				<h3>Abstract</h3>
				<p>This paper examines the controvesial Brexit vote and establishes how the liberal economic policies followed 
					across the world favoured the financial sector at the cost of industries, which caused resentment in the 
					hearts of the Brits and links the Brexit vote to the burst of Housing Bubble in 2007.
				</p>
				
				<h3>Introduction</h3>
				<p>
					Globalisation was the idealistic dream of those who believe in Adam Smith’s principles of laissez-faire, free-market fundamentals. However, over 17 million Brits chose for the UK to exit the European Union, essentially rejecting the ideals of market fundamentalism and globalisation. They did so against the advice of dozens of leading economists and this vote proves to be a threat to the role played by London in globalising and financializing the world economy.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, this vote to exit the EU was not a split decision, rather it was one long in making. Prior to the Global Crisis of 2007, the world saw a highly deregulated finance sector that undermined the power and effectiveness of the world governments. The deregulated finance sector forced down the price of labour and promoted trade and the actions of which caused a build up of large amounts of private debt. When the housing bubble burst in the US in August of 2007, it had a domino effect. The grand market failure caused a meltdown in the financial sector and the governments via their respective Central Banks bailed them out. This meant that the citizens and the taxpayers faced the brunt and many of them lost faith in the ideals of globalisation and autonomous self-regulating markets.
				</p>

				<h3>Discussion</h3>
				<p>
					A central concept of globalisation involves uninhibited global financial flow. For the better part of a century, the global financial flows increased and increased, however following the Global Crisis of 2007, they struggled to meet the pre-Crisis level. As a result, the cross border flows have declined which was expected to be even more aggravated post the Brexit vote especially if the UK decides to leave the EU with no trade agreement in place.
				</p>
				<p>
					The conservative government of Theresa May made it’s plans of regulating migrant movement across borders more stringently. This made it seem unlikely for any trade agreement to be drawn between the EU and UK which promoted universal access to the ‘single market’.
				</p>
				<p>
					Following the Global Crisis, the growth of world merchandise trade has slowed down and the G20 nations are becoming increasingly protectionist. According to the WTO, new trade regulations are being introduced at a rate far greater than the rate at which old one’s are being relaxed. Thus the Global Crisis has caused a reversal of globalisation. Infact, the re-regulation of the global economy was done by deflationary policies which imposed substantial costs on the productive economy which employed millions. Thus, the citizens who faced the brunt of liberal policies felt alienated by the liberal ideals of globalization.
				</p>
				<p>
					Following the introduction of Competition and Credit and Control regulatory framework in 1971, Britain followed an extremely liberal financial system which meant that bank lending was no longer driven by the viability of projects or borrowers, rather on the interest rates. Loans were granted to those who could afford to pay higher interest rates, rather than those whose projects deserved and needed them. The regulatory policies of 1979-1980 allowed UK based institutional investors to move their funds abroad away from UK industry. There was a steady tax (VAT) on goods and services produced by the industry, however the financial services were exempt from them. In the decade ending 1979, the financial sector grew by over 300% while the manufacturing sector grew by just 13%. The country’s debt rose by over 3700% from 1997 to 2013. While in the 1970s, the UK had a trade surplus of 4-6%, in 2010 it was running a deficit of 2-4%.The liberal policies introduced from 1970  meant that the financial sector grew at the cost of the industry, and this further alienated people from the idea of globalisation.
				</p>
				<p>
					Even today, the economic model followed remains largely unchanged from that pre-Crisis, as a result of which the policy makers still struggle to stabilise the financial system. 
With the Brexit vote, the Brits have rejected mainstream and orthodox ideas of liberal economics because of the hardships experienced by them in the form of repressed wages, rising housing costs, diminished public service etc. 
				</p>

				<h3>Conclusions</h3>
				<p>The liberal economic policies followed across the world have favoured the financial sector at the cost of industries which has caused resentment in the hearts of the citizens. After the Global Crisis of 2007, the world economies should have realised the flaws in the system and more stringent regulations should’ve been introduced in order to appease the citizens. The brunt of the failures of liberal economic policies has always been faced by the citizens while those who’ve caused the crisis have been bailed out by the world governments. Falling wages, increasing unemployment rate, loss of jobs to migrant workers, rising housing costs and diminished public service are just some of the reasons why the Brits opposed the liberal economic policies. The Brexit vote marks the dissatisfaction and loss of faith of Brits from liberal financial policies.
